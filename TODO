-- Create Lua rock for the library.
-- Use own auto-growing char buffer instead of Lua stack on save
   (model it after Lua's ZIO?). Do not touch stack at all in luabins_save()
   (except to leave an error message).
-- Enhance "corrupt data" message on load. Need more info on what is wrong.
   Ensure every case is covered with tests.
-- Autocompact integers (especially strings -- most of them do not need size_t!)
