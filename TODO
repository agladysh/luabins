-- Add key-value size-less table format (see luatexts)
-- Add utf-8 char-length string format (see luatexts)
-- Add autotest targets for LuaJIT and LuaJIT 2 x86, x86_64, both for Lua and C.
-- Test on Lua with custom allocator.
-- Use Makefile in rockspec?
-- Enhance "corrupt data" message on load. Need more info on what is wrong.
   Ensure every case is covered with tests.
-- Autocompact integers (especially strings -- most of them do not need size_t!)
-- Better cover new exponential growth strategy corner-cases with tests.
-- Shouldn't write and fwrite have common codebase?
-- Document write.h and fwrite.h
