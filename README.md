luabins â€” Lua Binary Serialization Library
==========================================

Allows to save tuples of primitive Lua types into binary chunks
and to load saved data back.

NB: You may be better off with luatexts: https://github.com/agladysh/luatexts.

On serialization
----------------

### Luabins works with

 *  `nil`
 *  `boolean`
 *  `number`
 *  `string`
 *  `table` (see below)

### Luabins refuses to save

 *  `function`
 *  `thread`
 *  `userdata`

Luabins intentionally does not save or check any meta-information
(versions, endianness etc.) along with data. If needed, it is to be handled
elsewhere.

### Table serialization

1.  Metatatables are ignored.
2.  Table nesting depth should be no more than `LUABINS_MAXTABLENESTING`.
3.  On table save references are not honored. Each encountered reference
    becomes independent object on load:

        local t = { 42 }
        { t, t }

    becomes

        { { 42 }, { 42 } }

    that is, three separate tables instead of two.

Lua API
-------

 *  `luabins.save(...)`

    Saves arguments into a binary string.

     *   On success returns that string.
     *   On failure returns nil and error message.

    Example:

        local str = assert(luabins.save(1, "two", { "three", 4 }))

 *  `luabins.load(string)`

    Loads a list of values from a binary string.

     *  On success returns true and loaded values.
     *  On failure returns nil and error message.

    Example:

    If you do not know in advance what data is stored inside a binary string,
    you may put results into a table:

        local values = { luabins.load(data) }
        assert(values[1], values[2])

    If you know how to handle stored values (for example you're sure they were
    generated following some established protocol), you may want to use
    something like this function to check `luabins.load()` result:

        function eat_true(t, ...)
            assert(t, ...)
            return ...
        end

        my_value_handler(eat_true(luabins.load(data)))

C API
-----

 * `int luabins_save(lua_State * L, int index_from, int index_to)`

    Save Lua values from given state at given stack index range.
    Lua value is left untouched. Note that empty range is not an error.
    You may save from 0 to `LUABINS_MAXTUPLE` values.
    Note only real non-negative indices work.

     *  On success returns 0, pushes saved data as a string on the top of stack.
     *  On failure returns non-zero, pushes error message on the top
        of the stack.

 * `int luabins_load(lua_State * L, const unsigned char * data,
    size_t len, int *count)`

    Load Lua values from given byte chunk.

     *  On success returns 0, pushes loaded values on stack.
        Sets count to the number of values pushed.
        Note that to have zero loaded items is a valid scenario.
     *  On failure returns non-zero, pushes error message on the top
        of the stack.

Luabins is still an experimental volatile software.
