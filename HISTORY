v0.3
====

Format unification for x86 and x86_64. Bug fixes.

WARNING: Format is not compatible with 0.2 and below.
         Only data saved on x86_64 is affected, though.
         Data, saved on x86, should load fine.

New features:

-- Format change: unified save format for x86 vs. x86_64.
-- API to save data to FILE * stream without Lua (see fwrite.h).

Bug fixes:

-- Load: fixed bug in readbyte, now it checks if we have data before read.
-- Load: fixed Lua C stack overflow bug on large data.

Misc:

-- Better module information.
   Replaced luabins.VERSION with _VERSION, _DESCRIPTION and _COPYRIGHT.
-- Added some CLI tools, useful for Luabins development (see etc/).
-- Some code cleanup.

v0.2
====

Lua-less saving.

-- New, 2x faster luabins.save() (see BENCHMARK).
-- API to save data manually, without Lua (see write.h).
-- Added Luarocks rockspecs (see rockspec/).
-- Fixed Makefile for Ubuntu.

v0.1.1
